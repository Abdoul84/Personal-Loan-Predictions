Predicting Mortgage Approval

Objective:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess mortgage approval based on individuals' demographic and financial attributes.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals, including age, sex, region, income, marital status, number of children, car ownership, savings account status, current account status, and the decision to purchase personal equity plans (PEP).

Data Processing:
- The dataset is loaded and explored using pandas.
- Categorical variables are encoded for machine learning compatibility.
- The data is split into training and testing sets.

Model Selection:
Logistic Regression is the classification algorithm for predicting mortgage approval due to its simplicity and interpretability.

Model Training:
The Logistic Regression model is trained on the training dataset.

Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on both the training and testing datasets.

Results:
The project concludes with insights into the model's predictive performance and potential applications in mortgage approval decision-making.
